# VBA JSON parse
This project idea came from a task I have recently had where I had to work with JSON data in Excel VBA.

Normally I would handle a task like this with Python that makes JSON data very easy to work with, but in this case I only had access to VBA.

This project goes through step by step, extracting the key/value pairs from the raw data, cleaning the pairs, putting them into easy to read forms, and even formatting the end result to make it look clean and easy to read.

The code is thoroughly commented for ease of understanding. The .xlsm file is posted here that can be ran, as well as the code on its own and an .xlsx file that shows the end result of the macro from the raw_data stage through the formatted_result version.

The data came from https://www.mockaroo.com/, so full credit to them for providing great example JSON data.
